# Mission
The goal is a multiplayer rpg dating sim. We have a lot of ideas, but are not really set on much. The dating aspect would be like Stardew Valley mixed with Fire Emblem. The dating merges with combat, as dating different people affects your skills. The gameplay is your typical RPG, with world progression and story. Combat is mobs and bosses. The game is really like Stardew if you replace farming with mob combat and made the dating mechanics much better.
